# About
A very simple Password Encryptor made using Python. Takes the application you are wanting to save the log-in information for. Then it will ask you for your username and password for that application. It will then encrypt your log-in information, and store it into a .txt file formatted "Destination: {application}, {encUsername}, {encPassword}".
